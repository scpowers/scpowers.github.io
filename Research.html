				<h2>Unsupervised learning of neural population codewords with a latent variable model </h2>
			
					<div class="details" align="justify">[Research conducted remotely under Dr. Michael J. Berry II (Princeton Neuroscience Institute)]

						Machine learning with spiking neural networks can potentially benefit from the use of learning principles drawn 
						from neuroscience, as many conventional learning approaches require differentiable and thus non-bio-plausible neuron activation 
						functions. By approximating the population code of the LGN as a latent variable model, the population responses to discrete 
						stimuli are organized into clusters that can be learned in an unsupervised fashion. This approach is desirable because it is 
						inherently error-correcting in the sense that stochastic fluctuations in population response to the same stimulus will robustly 
						elicit the associated cluster.  </div>

				<h2>Investigating the application of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to plasma disruption prediction in tokamaks </h2>
					<div class="details" align="justify">Spiking neural networks show promise for the task of learning to predict plasma disruptions in tokamaks 
						in real time for two primary reasons. First, their inherent short-term memory gives them an affinity for learning 
						time-series problems. Second, because activity can propagate to higher layers asynchronously, rapid initial 
						classification is possible. This fast response is potentially useful in plasma control systems, which need to 
						predict disruption events within a maximally long warning window in order to take countermeasures. This project 
						uses shot data from the DIII-D tokamak in San Diego. </div>

				<h2>PHYS 760 Research Project: Investigating the Topological Dimension of a Novel Manufacturing Method for Neuromorphic Hardware </h2>
					<div class="details" align="justify">
						[<a href="scpowers.github.io/pdfs/SCP_PHYS760_Final.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #0099cc">Report (PDF)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scpowers/nanowire_topology" style="color: #0099cc">Github repo</a>] <br>
						Recent work by Pantone et al. from Rain Neuromorphics proved that their novel manufacturing method for 
						neuromorphic hardware naturally produces small-world networks, a hallmark characteristic of real connectomes. However, 
						the criticality hypothesis implies that small-worldness does not completely describe the network topology of the brain, and 
						introduces hierarchical modular networks (HMNs) as a viable alternative. This work reproduces the results of Pantone et al. 
						from scratch, then extends the analysis to investigate the feasibility of producing HMNs with the same nanowire deposition 
						process.
